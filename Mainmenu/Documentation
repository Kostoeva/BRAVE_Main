Main Menu
Creating a simply starting menu that allows users to select sound and difficulty of the maze. 

For more information visit: https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/user-interface-ui/creating-main-menu

	In charge of:
Create links between setting/difficulty/start of the maze
	
	How to Use:
Create Canvas. (GameObject -> UI -> Canvas)
Under the Canvas, create panels to separate between different functions of the main menu such as audio and brightness. (GameObject -> UI -> Panels)
Under each of the panels, create buttons depending on how many you need (GameObject -> UI -> Button)
Open Scenes by going to File -> Build Settings -> Open Scenes 
Do this while being in the scene you want to use (switching to and from)
Attach the LoadSceneOnClick script onto each of the buttons and assign a number
This number will correspond to the order in “Open Scenes” from set 4
For example, if I click on the button “Medium Difficulty”, it would load the scene that activates the maze in medium difficulty

Simplified Code:

using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

public class LoadSceneOnClick : MonoBehaviour {

    public void LoadByIndex(int sceneIndex)
    {
        SceneManager.LoadScene (sceneIndex);
    }
}


	Reasons to edit:
Instead of using a click to trigger an event (switching setting/difficulty), using a different mode of trigger (such as ray gun)
Edit design of the VR environment
